# Fight-game

This is a simple personal project for me to understand and learn oop programming
without it being boring.

It's a simple two person fighting game and you need two players for it, currently it
doesn't support a 1 player the reason being that it doesn't have an ai, hopefully i will
add it in the feature and who knows? maybe i would release it as a full game :)

For lunching it you just have to clone the project or just download it and run the 
index.html file in your browser.

Controls for player 1:  
W: Jump,  
D: go right,

Controls for player 2:  
ArrowUp: Jump,
